For the sake of your sanity, i have organized everything

there are 4 sets, 6 emotions with nude and clothed variations

another set for "universal" portraits for admmirals and admins at unhabitable worlds

path goes ".../vulpoid_portraits/x_set/nude or clothed/emote"

so that you can easily swap arctic to terran for example by changing only single point in path
