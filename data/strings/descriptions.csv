vulpoids,RESOURCE,"Vulpoids are an experimental lifeform designed by the long-gone Exodyne Biotech megacorporation. Envisioned as 'useful pets', they're made to be highly affectionate towards humans, and psychologically compelled to assist and obey their owners however they can. Their humanoid anatomy and basic level of intelligence makes them able to do chores, but not complex tasks.

Their design was leaked during development, attracting substantial public controversy. Ethical concerns dominated the conversation, but an inquest into whether the Vulpoids exceeded the legal limit of delta-level AI forced Exodyne to relocate their research facilities into fringe space. The inquest was not completed before the Collapse, so whether Vulpoids should qualify as delta or gamma remains unclear.

Vulpoids are a triumph of Domain-era bioengineering, designed to require a minimum of ameneties while providing as much as possible for their owner. Their calorie needs are low, their adorableness is high, and their fur is incredibly fluffy. Regrettably, the Sector is a much rougher enviroment than they were designed for. Their low strength, lack of independence, and inability to learn complex skills makes them ill-suited to serve as spacers. A Vulpoid in the Sector won't last long without an owner to take care of it.",,,,
mangonuts,RESOURCE,"A genetically-modified fruit grown from mangonut trees. The flesh is sweet, with a somewhat meaty texture. The sterile pit is also soft enough to eat, and has a delicious, nutty flavor. Both components are highly nutritious, and contain natural preservatives that keep the fruit fresh for cycles after picking. A next-generation foodstuff from the late pre-Collapse era.

The precise composition of the mangonut is a curiosity to bioscientists. It grows from trees, yet its flesh is most similar to fungal trama. In addition, the nut and surrounding flesh is extremely rich in theobromine, a principal chemical in cacao and strong narcotic for Vulpoids.",,,,
vulp_geck,SHIP,"This vessel superficially resembles a Paragon-class battleship, but has been dramatically modified at the forge level with pre-Collapse techniques. Records indicate that the Tri-Tachyon corporation intended to produce these as heavily-automated superyachts to be sold and operated deep in the heart of Domain space. They never reached the open market before the Collapse, and there is no public documentation as a result.

This particular one was leased by the Exodyne Biotech corporation as an experimental reasearch vessel, taking advantage of the top-of-the-line environmental systems to support their biotech facilities.",Unidentified Vessel,"Target profile closely matches a Paragon-class battleship, with substantial structural modifications made using pre-Collapse industrial methods. Mass distributions are characteristic of a militarized civilian ship, but sensors indicate capital-grade weapon loadout. Exercise caution.",,
vulp_terraformer,SHIP,"This vessel is a titanic capital ship designed to terraform entire planets at a speed and efficacy unseen even at the height of the Domain. When fully outfitted with its suite of terraforming technology, it could tear apart mountain ranges, pour out oceans and atmospheres, and implant entire pre-printed biospheres. No pre-Collapse records of this vessel exists.

Its interior volume is unmatched in scale, possessing a vast, self-sustaining biodome with an exotically beautiful ecology. Bioluminescent rivers weave through groves of prismatic trees and past geometric cottages. The air is still and clean, and strange fruits grow plentifully from bushes that fringe the trails. None of the species have been successfully transplanted or replicated, and the arcane pre-Collapse technology was designed for performance over efficiency.

This vessel was presumably intended to be used by the Eridani-Utopia Terraforming Corporation to terraform the worlds of the Persean Sector. It failed to arrive before the Collapse and subsequently lost course during the Cold Passage, becoming lost in the Orion-Perseus Abyss. This has led to a reputation of it being haunted, with some spacers claiming to have glimpsed sinister violet lights down empty corridors.",Unidentified Vessel,"Target profile superficially matches an Astral-class carrier, with near-total structual redesign using non-publicized pre-Collapse industrial methods. Multiple exotic energy sources detected. Exercise extreme caution.",,
