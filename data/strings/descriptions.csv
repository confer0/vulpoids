vulpoids,RESOURCE,"Vulpoids are an experimental lifeform developed as a personal project of an Exodyne Biotech executive. Envisioned as ""useful pets"", their bipedal anatomy makes them compatible with most human equipment and machinery, and a basic level of intelligence enables them to fulfill simple tasks without requiring the same degree of amenities as a human worker.

In response to public controversy, the Domain classified the Vulpoids as gamma-plus level artificial intelligence and subject to AI regulations. This classification persists in the legal codes of most polities of the Persean Sector, though relatively few factions care to enforce it. However, higher-up faction representatives may be willing to purchase them directly, though their reasons for doing so may vary.

Vulpoids bear superficial resemblance to both humans and vulpids, but in actuality are an entirely distinct artificial lifeform. They've been optimized to act as both workers on fringe outposts, as well as personal assistants or companions for elites. For the former they have lower calorie requirements, robust temperature tolerances, fairly acute senses, and even resilience to suffocation. For the latter they have an appealing appearance, enough linguistic ability to make charming - if not particularly deep - conversation, and a natural 'imprinting' reflex that causes adoration towards their owner. Both use cases attracted colossal public controversy, leading to the Domain cracking down by classifying them as gamma-level AI despite most experts agreeing that they operated at no higher than delta-level.",,,,
vulpoids_shiny,RESOURCE,"Profecto Vulpoids are the result of a manufacturing defect in a regular Vulpoid. A fault in their cognitive regression system causes runaway neural growth, and in rare cases the individual survives the process. The extreme neural density gives them a cognitive capacity surpassing most humans, with their social intelligence in particular rivalling that of a beta core.

In response to public controversy, the Domain classified the Vulpoids as gamma-plus level artificial intelligence and subject to AI regulations. This classification persists in the legal codes of most polities of the Persean Sector, though relatively few factions care to enforce it. However, higher-up faction representatives may be willing to purchase them directly, though their reasons for doing so may vary.

No public information regarding Profectos exists, no doubt owing to Exodyne taking great efforts to keep this ethical disaster under wraps. Recovered documentation indicates that Exodyne was unable to determine what enabled the reliable survival of a growing Profecto, meaning any attempt at producing them would involve the death of dozens of sapients for each unit produced. As a result, Profectos were only obtained out of chance manufacturing defects, and then only rarely.

Profectos themselves are vastly more intelligent than ordinary Vulpoids, but still retain some of the characteristic personality quirks encoded into their design. Most critically is their imprinting reflex, which remains functional and is even strengthened by the increased neural density. As a result, Profectos are highly loyal towards their owner despite their lack of naivety. This makes it feasible to grant them a degree of independence that would normally be considered extremely for an artificial intelligence, allowing them to make full use of their intellectual capabilities in the course of their duties.",,,,
vulp_geck,SHIP,"This vessel superficially resembles a Paragon-class battleship, but has received radical structural modifications to convert it into a flagship of unprecedented scale.",Unidentified Vessel,"Target profile closely matches a Paragon-class battleship, with substantial structural modifications made using pre-Collapse industrial methods. Mass distributions are characteristic of a militarized civilian ship, but sensors indicate capital-grade weapon loadout. Exercise caution.",,
