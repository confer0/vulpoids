vulpoids,RESOURCE,"Vulpoids are an experimental lifeform designed by the long-gone Exodyne Biotech megacorporation. Envisioned as 'useful pets', they're made to be highly affectionate towards humans, and psychologically compelled to assist and obey their owners however they can. Their humanoid anatomy and basic level of intelligence makes them able to do chores, but not complex tasks.

Their design was leaked during development, attracting substantial public controversy. Ethical concerms dominated the conversation, but an inquest into whether the Vulpoids exceeded the legal limit of delta-level AI was what forced Exodyne to relocate their research facilities into fringe space. The inquest was not completed before the Collapse, so whether Vulpoids should qualify as delta or gamma remains unclear.

Vulpoids are a triumph of Domain-era bioengineering, designed to require a minimum of ameneties while providing as much as possible for their owner. Their calorie needs are low, their adorableness is high, and their fur is incredibly fluffy. Regrettably, the Sector is a much rougher enviroment than they were designed for. Their low strength, lack of independence, and inability to learn complex skills makes them ill-suited to serve as spacers. A Vulpoid in the Sector won't last long without an owner to take care of it.",,,,
vulp_geck,SHIP,"This vessel superficially resembles a Paragon-class battleship, but has been dramatically modified at the forge level with pre-Collapse techniques. Records indicate that the Tri-Tachyon corporation intended to produce these as heavily-automated superyachts to be sold and operated deep in the heart of Domain space. They never reached the open market before the Collapse, and there is no public documentation as a result.

This particular one was leased by the Exodyne Biotech corporation as an experimental reasearch vessel, taking advantage of the top-of-the-line environmental systems to support their biotech facilities.",Unidentified Vessel,"Target profile closely matches a Paragon-class battleship, with substantial structural modifications made using pre-Collapse industrial methods. Mass distributions are characteristic of a militarized civilian ship, but sensors indicate capital-grade weapon loadout. Exercise caution.",,

,,"Vulpoids are an experimental lifeform developed as a personal project of an Exodyne Biotech executive. Envisioned as ""useful pets"", their bipedal anatomy makes them compatible with most human equipment and machinery, and a basic level of intelligence enables them to fulfill simple tasks without requiring the same degree of amenities as a human worker.",,,,

,,"In response to public controversy, the Domain classified the Vulpoids as gamma-plus level artificial intelligence and subject to AI regulations. This classification persists in the legal codes of most polities of the Persean Sector, though relatively few factions care to enforce it. However, higher-up faction representatives may be willing to purchase them directly, though their reasons for doing so may vary.",,,,

,,"Vulpoids bear superficial resemblance to both humans and vulpids, but in actuality are an entirely distinct artificial lifeform. They've been optimized to act as both workers on fringe outposts, as well as personal assistants or companions for elites. For the former they have lower calorie requirements, robust temperature tolerances, fairly acute senses, and even resilience to suffocation. For the latter they have an appealing appearance, enough linguistic ability to make charming - if not particularly deep - conversation, and a natural 'imprinting' reflex that causes adoration towards their owner. Both use cases attracted colossal public controversy, leading to the Domain cracking down by classifying them as gamma-level AI despite most experts agreeing that they operated at no higher than delta-level.",,,,
