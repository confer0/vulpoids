vulpoids,RESOURCE,"Vulpoids are an experimental lifeform developed as a personal project of an Exodyne Biotech executive. Envisioned as ""useful pets"", their bipedal anatomy makes them compatible with most human equipment and machinery, and a basic level of intelligence enables them to fulfill basic tasks without requiring the same degree of amenities as a human worker.

In response to public controversy, the Domain classified the Vulpoids as Gamma-plus level artificial intelligence and subject to AI regulations. This classification persists in the legal codes of most polities of the Persean Sector, making them illegal on the open market. However, higher-up faction representatives may be willing to purchase them directly, though their reasons for doing so may vary.

Vulpoids bear superficial resemblance to both humans and vulpids, but in actuality are an entirely distinct artificial lifeform. They've been optimized to act as both workers on fringe outposts, as well as personal assistants or companions for elites. For the former they have lower calorie requirements, robust temperature tolerances, fairly acute senses, and even resilience to suffocation. For the latter they have an appealing appearance, and enough linguistic ability to make charming - if not particularly deep - conversation. Both use cases attracted massive public controversy, leading to a Domain crackdown.",,,,
