vulpoids,RESOURCE,"Vulpoids are an experimental lifeform developed as a personal project of an Exodyne Biotech executive. Envisioned as ""useful pets"", their bipedal anatomy makes them compatible with most human equipment and machinery, and a basic level of intelligence enables them to fulfill simple tasks without requiring the same degree of amenities as a human worker.

In response to public controversy, the Domain classified the Vulpoids as gamma-plus level artificial intelligence and subject to AI regulations. This classification persists in the legal codes of most polities of the Persean Sector, though relatively few factions care to enforce it. However, higher-up faction representatives may be willing to purchase them directly, though their reasons for doing so may vary.

Vulpoids bear superficial resemblance to both humans and vulpids, but in actuality are an entirely distinct artificial lifeform. They've been optimized to act as both workers on fringe outposts, as well as personal assistants or companions for elites. For the former they have lower calorie requirements, robust temperature tolerances, fairly acute senses, and even resilience to suffocation. For the latter they have an appealing appearance, enough linguistic ability to make charming - if not particularly deep - conversation, and a natural 'imprinting' reflex that causes adoration towards their owner. Both use cases attracted colossal public controversy, leading to the Domain cracking down by classifying them as gamma-level AI despite most experts agreeing that they operated at no higher than delta-level.",,,,
vulp_geck,SHIP,"This vessel superficially resembles a Paragon-class battleship, but has received radical structural modifications to convert it into a flagship of unprecedented scale and capability. Computer records suggest it was originally designed to be marketed as a heavily-automated superyacht for use in the heart of Domain space, but presumably it never reached the open market before the Collapse.

This particular one was leased by the Exodyne Biotech corporation as an experimental reasearch vessel, taking advantage of the top-of-the-line environmental systems to support their biotech facilities.",Unidentified Vessel,"Target profile closely matches a Paragon-class battleship, with substantial structural modifications made using pre-Collapse industrial methods. Mass distributions are characteristic of a militarized civilian ship, but sensors indicate capital-grade weapon loadout. Exercise caution.",,
