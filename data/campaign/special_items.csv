Due to their classification as AI by the Domain Vulpoids are considered illegal in most of the Sector, though Hegemony tech inspections are typically more concerned with true AI cores. Like a more conventional biofactory, it requires habitable conditions to reliably gestate its Vulpoid workforce.",155

Radiation exposure has resulted in permanent and irrepairable genetic damage, and it's incapable of producing anything more than exotically deformed bodies with organs in various states of functionality. Thanks to both integrated failsafes and its weakened state, the biofactory requires habitable planetary conditions to operate.",155
