The exact mechanisms of operation are not clearly understood, but it is known to utilize nanite gels that require a small trickle of transplutonics to maintain. It's designed to be installed into a specialized facility, although it is just barely possible to repurpose a current-day organ farm to support it.",157

While slightly damaged from centuries under the deep oceans of Volturn, it's still quite capable of producing industrial quantities of lobsters. Some will breed true and eventually produce a self-sustaining population on water or terran worlds, while the remaining sterile population can be rerouted to local storage.",156.5

Radiation exposure and lack of maintenance has destroyed its delicate nanite pseudogenes, and it's now incapable of producing anything more than deformed bodies and organs in various states of functionality. Despite this, it's still more sophisticated than the technology used in current-day organ farms.",156

This one was repurposed from a Midas-class Eridani-Utopia Terraforming ship. Its manufacturing systems are designed to utilize raw ore, presumably intended to be used to manufacture terraforming machinery in-situ. It's almost concerningly easy to adapt it for weapons production.",139.15
Mangonut Mother Tree,mangonut_tree,pather2,Exodyne Biotech,,120000,1000,1,EXTREME,graphics/icons/cargo/mangonut_tree.png,ui_cargo_special_industrial_pickup,ui_cargo_special_industrial_drop,com.fs.starfarer.api.campaign.impl.items.GenericSpecialItemPlugin,farming,"A bioengineered tree that can be planted on most habitable worlds. It produces seeds for orchards of mangonut trees. The trees' fruits are a highly robust foodstuff, and their far-reaching root structures assist with soil enrichment in more traditional farms as well. Unfortunately the seeds cannot be transported between planets due to a sensitivity to gravitational shifts, likely thanks to a genetic failsafe.

Recovered records suggest this tree was designed by Exodyne Biotech at the request of Eridani-Utopia. It was likely intended to be used alongside the Vulpoids to create a luxury resort world.",151

Uses highly sophisticated nanites suspended by exotic fields to generate a nanofog, which is able to manipulate atmospheric conditions planet-wide. It can neutralize toxic gasses, influence weather patterns, and even recapture industrial pollutants.

At its full potential, this could have converted even a marginally habitable world into one that rivalled the likes of Gilead and old Mairaath. Unfortunately, the lack of supporting technology and technical expertise in the Sector means its effects cannot be made persistent, and can lead to the formation of cascading storm systems if the demand for volatiles and transplutonics is not met.",138
