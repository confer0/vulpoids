This one was repurposed from a Midas-class Eridani-Utopia Terraforming ship. Its manufacturing systems are designed to utilize raw ore, presumably intended to be used to manufacture terraforming machinery in-situ. It's almost concerningly easy to adapt it for weapons production.",139.15

It produces seeds for orchards of mangonut trees. The trees' fruits are a highly robust foodstuff, and their far-reaching root structures assist with soil enrichment in more traditional farms as well. Unfortunately the seeds cannot be transported between planets due to a sensitivity to gravitational shifts, likely thanks to a genetic failsafe.

Recovered records suggest this tree was designed by Exodyne Biotech at the request of Eridani-Utopia. It was likely intended to be used alongside the Vulpoids to create a luxury resort world.",151

Unlike their simpleminded counterparts, Profectos are highly intelligent - comparable to a beta core in most respects. This enables them to perform any duty that a human can, up to and including spacecraft command and planetary administration.

Profectos retain the basal instinct to serve humans, but their intelligence enables them to treat it as a craving rather than a core part of their personality. Just as humans limit sugar consumption to protect their health, Profectos limit their servility to protect their independence. Overindulgence may be pleasant in the immediate term, but can have consequences for one's health or independence, respectively.

Prior to the Collapse Exodyne had invested significant efforts into determining the root cause of the Profecto mutation. Their research had managed to determine that it was a failure in the cognitive regressor: the system designed to limit Vulpoids to the sub-gamma level in compliance with Domain AI regulations. A rare issue caused the process to invert, causing an explosion in neural complexity that was mostly lethal but occasionally survivable with incredible intellect as the result. The root cause was never satisfactorily determined before the Collapse halted all studies.",0

Being physically identical to their standard counterparts, Profectos are designed to easily enter and exit cryosleep for shipment as cargo. Rather than being an intensive medical procedure, Vulpoid cryosuspension is most analagous to a deep sleep, where weeks pass like seconds under the lull of pleasant, indistinct dreams.

Profectos in cryosleep can be stored and traded without much difficulty, as their cryopods are easily 'mistaken' for one containing a human.",504

While Vulpoids should technically have no issue with staying in a crew berth, they naturally gravitate towards higher-class spaces thanks to their original design as domestic servants. As officers find no issue with a Vulpoid being closer to hand, this almost inevitably results in a Profecto making itself at home in the suites.

Absent any larger responsibilities, a Profecto can be tasked with various projects that they're chiefly suited to - chief among these being compiling assorted data on Vulpoids.",503

In no field is the gap between standard and Profecto Vulpoids more apparent than spacecraft command. The neurological changes that lead to Profecto development brings their reflexes up from 'adorably clumsy' to 'lightning-fast', improves their situational awareness enough to keep track of a battle, and gives them enough self-confidence to issue the orders required of a commanding officer.

Although they don't initially come with the same skills as a trained human, Profectos learn quickly and masterfully. With time and experience they'll surpass all but the most capable admirals.",502

Being tailor-made to be pleasant to interact with, Vulpoids naturally excel at social interaction. Profectos are intelligent enough to actually leverage this to their advantage, using their people-pleasing abilities to broker deals and assuage concerns as capably as any politician. 

Under a Profecto administrator the population is happier and trade flows more freely, all while requiring less intervention from faction leadership.",501

At its full potential, this could have converted even a marginally habitable world into one that rivalled the likes of Gilead and old Mairaath. Unfortunately, the lack of supporting technology and technical expertise in the Sector means its effects cannot be made persistent, and can lead to the formation of cascading storm systems if the demand for volatiles and transplutonics is not met.",138
