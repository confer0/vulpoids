The exact mechanisms of operation are not clearly understood, but it is known to utilize nanite gels that require a small trickle of transplutonics to maintain. It's designed to be installed into a specialized facility, although it is just barely possible to repurpose a current-day organ farm to support it.",155

Radiation exposure and lack of maintenance has destroyed its delicate nanite pseudogenes, and it's now incapable of producing anything more than deformed bodies and organs in various states of functionality. Despite this, it's still more sophisticated than the technology used in current-day organ farms.",155
