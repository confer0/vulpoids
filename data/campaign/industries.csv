Typically achieved by leveraging medical equipment to regenerate a piece of an existing organ, then dividing it into multiple fragments and repeat the process. The process is extremely oxygen and water hungry, and can only be reasonably sustained on habitable worlds.",290,MEDIUM

While the result is not flawless, the resulting megacomplex is still capable of incredible feats of bioengineering. Vast quantities of sugars, organic slurry, and oxygen are constantly refined and grown into organs and other biological products.",291,MEDIUM
