There's a heavy clank, all turn to find that Kanta is standing, trailing trophies and tubes. ""WE ACCEPT,"" her vocoder blasts, the voice inhuman. ""Vacuum AND fire shall greet those prisoners I wish to dispose.""

Finally, Kanta's gauntleted hand, strength enhanced by cybernetics, shoves Cydonia away like a dewy-eyed lapdog. He nearly topples from the platform, but manages to recover his balance.
