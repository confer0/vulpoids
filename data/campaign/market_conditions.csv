Anti-Vulpoid Sanctions,vulpoid_blockade,,TRUE,vulpoids.impl.campaign.econ.VulpoidBlockade,"Political sanctions and religious proclamations regarding Vulpoid manufacture are significantly impairing trade to and from $market. Any prospective trader is forced to cut through massive swathes of red tape, and any failure to abide by the strict and convoluted regulations could see the revocation of licenses or even seizure of assets.",graphics/icons/campaign/vulpoidAcceptance_sanctions.png,1390

Vulpoid Customs Agents,vulpoid_traders,,TRUE,vulpoids.impl.campaign.econ.workforces.TraderWorkforce,"Effective customer service work at spaceports requires a working knowledge of cargo logistics and spacecraft operations. While Vulpoids may not be able to handle everything, with enough training they can still serve as effective tier-one support.

A spaceport catered by Vulpoids will provide a top-tier experience for visiting traders, and encourage them to visit more frequently even if another port might offer slightly higher profits. Those lost margins end up bolstering colony revenue instead.",graphics/icons/markets/workforce_traders.png,31
Vulpoid Security Foxes,vulpoid_security,,TRUE,vulpoids.impl.campaign.econ.workforces.SecurityWorkforce,"Vulpoids have impressive emotional intelligence as-built, but they struggle to perceive humans in a negative light. A human handler can help pick up that slack, allowing security forces can use them as the emotional equivalent of sniffer dogs.

A K9 unit using Vulpoids is significantly more effective at identifying individuals with problematic ideologies, making it difficult for criminal or terrorist networks to obtain support. In particular, Luddic Path cells will be unable to coordinate attacks under these conditions.",graphics/icons/markets/workforce_security.png,32
Vulpoid Celebrities,vulpoid_celebrities,,TRUE,vulpoids.impl.campaign.econ.workforces.CelebrityWorkforce,"Vulpoids have pretty voices, a beautiful appearance, and a sincere willingness to be underpaid and exploited just for a chance to entertain humans. In short, they're perfect for the holo-media industry.

Featuring Vulpoids in cinema, music, fashion, advertisements, and more will significantly bolster consumerism. Immigration and income will be increased, but so will demand for commercial goods.",graphics/icons/markets/workforce_celebrities.png,33
Vulpoid Farmers,vulpoid_farmers,,TRUE,vulpoids.impl.campaign.econ.workforces.FarmerWorkforce,"Vulpoids are surprisingly passionate farmers and agriculturalists, beyond even what would be expected for a being designed to tend wealthy individuals' gardens. This inherent propensity towards farm work makes them a shoe-in to supplement the industry.

Fields planted and tended by Vulpoids resemble the those of Venera, blooming lush and colorful even on seemingly-inarable land. This will result in substantially increased yield from farming operations.",graphics/icons/markets/workforce_farmers.png,34
Vulpoid Mine Laborers,vulpoid_miners,,TRUE,vulpoids.impl.campaign.econ.workforces.MinerWorkforce,"Vulpoids are not well-suited for performing hard labor or operating heavy machinery. Powered exoskeletons normally used on high-gravity worlds can supplement their strength, enabling them to work shoulder-to-shoulder with human miners.

Mines with Vulpoid workers benefit from an enlarged workforce with better-motivated humans, if one is willing to endure occasional protests regarding the Vulpoids' safety. Although it causes minor disruption to stability, this will result in increased yields from mining operations.",graphics/icons/markets/workforce_miners.png,35
Divine Fox Cult,vulpoid_cults,,TRUE,vulpoids.impl.campaign.econ.workforces.CultWorkforce,"The ongoing Luddic renaissance has created a cult-like following around Vulpoids. Many believers have concluded that Vulpoids are angelic servants, sent by God at Ludd's behest to soothe the tired souls of the Persean Sector.

These movements improve social cohesion and Vulpoid acceptance among the population, improving the colony's overall stability. It also enables the local government to improve relations with the Luddic population at large, who will press their overarching governments to respond in kind.",graphics/icons/markets/workforce_cults.png,36
Vulpoid Orbital Workers,vulpoid_maintenance,,TRUE,vulpoids.impl.campaign.econ.workforces.MaintenanceWorkforce,"Under most circumstances Vulpoids are not intelligent enough to be trusted with spaceflight operations. However, a sufficiently large population makes it possible to identify candidates to the far-right of the bell curve, and train them on basic orbital operations such as shuttle piloting, drone tending, and basic maintenance.

Their assistance, in combination of the increased size and motivation of the human workforce in response to their presence, will be an incredible boon to our intra-orbital logistics.",graphics/icons/markets/workforce_maintenance.png,37
Vulpoid Servants,vulpoid_servants,,TRUE,vulpoids.impl.campaign.econ.workforces.ServantWorkforce,"Humans and Vulpoids mutually want humans to be served by Vulpoids, but without intervention Vulpoids often end up distributed based on people's wealth. With an official distribution program, a much more equal spread of Vulpoids across the population can be achieved, ensuring no household is without one.

Homes with Vulpoids have been proven to report general satisfaction ratings several deviations above the mean, and a colony-wide distribution program will massively improve quality-of-life for the entire population.",graphics/icons/markets/workforce_servants.png,38
Vulpoid Clerks,vulpoid_clerks,,TRUE,vulpoids.impl.campaign.econ.workforces.ClerkWorkforce,"Rather than excluding Vulpoids from the traditional economy, they can be intentionally integrated. Although they'll never be able to replace skilled positions, there's a wide range of white-collar jobs that they can perform to a reasonable standard given enough training.

This can free up human workers for more skilled jobs, thereby increasing the colony's industrial capacity. The increased wages, in combination with other economic shifts, will negatively impact income.",graphics/icons/markets/workforce_clerks.png,39
