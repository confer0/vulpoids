Vulpoid Customs Agents,vulpoid_traders,,TRUE,vulpoids.impl.campaign.econ.workforces.TraderWorkforce,"Effective customer service work at spaceports requires a working knowledge of cargo logistics and spacecraft operations. While Vulpoids may not be able to handle everything, with enough training they can still serve as effective tier-one support.

A spaceport catered by Vulpoids will provide a top-tier experience for visiting traders, and encourage them to visit more frequently even if another port might offer slightly higher profits. Those lost margins end up bolstering colony revenue instead.",graphics/icons/markets/workforce_traders.png,31
Vulpoid Security Foxes,vulpoid_security,,TRUE,vulpoids.impl.campaign.econ.workforces.SecurityWorkforce,"Vulpoids have impressive emotional intelligence as-built, but they struggle to perceive humans in a negative light. A human handler can help pick up that slack, allowing our security forces can use them as the emotional equivalent of sniffer dogs.

A K9 unit using Vulpoids is significantly more effective at identifying individuals with problematic ideologies, making it difficult for criminal or terrorist networks to obtain support. In particular, Luddic Path cells will be unable to coordinate attacks under these conditions.",graphics/icons/markets/workforce_security.png,32
Vulpoid Mine Laborers,vulpoid_miners,,TRUE,vulpoids.impl.campaign.econ.workforces.MinerWorkforce,"Vulpoids are not well-suited for performing hard labor or operating heavy machinery. Powered exoskeletons normally used on high-gravity worlds can supplement their strength, enabling them to work shoulder-to-shoulder with human miners.

Mines with Vulpoid workers benefit from an enlarged workforce with better-motivated humans, if one is willing to endure occasional protests regarding the Vulpoids' safety. Although it causes minor disruption to stability, this will result in increased yields from mining operations.",graphics/icons/markets/workforce_miners.png,33
Vulpoid Orbital Workers,vulpoid_maintenance,,TRUE,vulpoids.impl.campaign.econ.workforces.MaintenanceWorkforce,"Under most circumstances Vulpoids are not intelligent enough to be trusted with spaceflight operations. However, a sufficiently large population means we can identify candidates to the far-right of the bell curve, and train them on basic orbital operations such as shuttle piloting, drone tending, and basic maintenance.

Their assistance, in combination of the increased size and motivation of the human workforce in response to their presence, will be an incredible boon to our intra-orbital logistics.",graphics/icons/markets/workforce_maintenance.png,34
Vulpoid Servants,vulpoid_servants,,TRUE,vulpoids.impl.campaign.econ.workforces.ServantWorkforce,"Humans and Vulpoids mutually want humans to be served by Vulpoids, but without intervention Vulpoids often end up distributed based on people's wealth. With an official distribution program, we can achieve a much more equal spread of Vulpoids across the population, ensuring no household is without one.

Homes with Vulpoids have been proven to report general satisfaction ratings several deviations above the mean, and a colony-wide distribution program will massively improve quality-of-life for the entire population.",graphics/icons/markets/workforce_servants.png,35
Vulpoid Clerks,vulpoid_clerks,,TRUE,vulpoids.impl.campaign.econ.workforces.ClerkWorkforce,"Rather than excluding Vulpoids from the traditional economy, we can integrate them. Although they'll never be able to replace skilled positions, there's a wide range of white-collar jobs that they can perform to a reasonable standard given enough training.

This would free up human workers for more skilled jobs, thereby increasing the colony's industrial capacity. The increased wages, in combination with other economic shifts, will negatively impact income.",graphics/icons/markets/workforce_clerks.png,36
